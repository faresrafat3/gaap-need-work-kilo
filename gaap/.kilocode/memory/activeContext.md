# Sovereign Active Context (v2.1.0)

## Current Focus
- **Sovereign Cognition:** Operating in Full OODA Loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) mode.
- **Multi-Domain Intelligence:** Handling Research, Diagnostic, and Coding tasks with specialized adaptive strategies.
- **Cognitive Security:** Maintaining the 7-Layer Semantic Firewall and DLP Shield.

## Current State
- **Layer 1 (Strategic):** Uses STORM-augmented research and dynamic Thinking Streams.
- **Layer 2 (Tactical):** Uses context-aware task decomposition with 15+ specialized categories.
- **Layer 3 (Execution):** Uses dynamic personas, tool filtering, and Metacognitive confidence scoring.
- **Memory:** Domain-partitioned episodic storage is active and specialized.

## Immediate Next Steps (Autonomous)
- Continuous refinement of the Sovereign IQ scenarios.
- Expansion of the Just-in-Time Tool Synthesis library.
- Real-time monitoring of agent reputation across the swarm.
