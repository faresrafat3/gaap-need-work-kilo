# Sovereign System Patterns (v2.1.0)

## Cognitive Architecture: Circular OODA Loop
- **Observe (L0):** Intent classification, complexity analysis, and 7-layer semantic firewall scanning.
- **Orient (L1):** STORM-augmented deep research and dynamic Tree of Thoughts strategy generation.
- **Decide (L2):** Multi-domain task decomposition using context-aware tactical categorization (15+ types).
- **Act (L3):** Specialized persona execution (Researcher, Coder, Debugger) with tool-filtered sandboxing and JIT Tool Synthesis.
- **Learn (L4):** Metacognitive reflection, domain-partitioned episodic memory, and reputation tracking.

## Core Philosophical Patterns
- **Contextual Adaptation:** No fixed strategy; every intent (Research, Code, Diagnostic) triggers a unique cognitive stream.
- **Epistemic Doubt:** Metacognitive confidence scoring is mandatory before any high-stakes execution.
- **Sovereign Tooling:** Tools are not just used; they are synthesized on-demand and restricted by domain tags.
- **Reflexive Healing:** Failures trigger root-cause analysis (Verbal Reinforcement) instead of simple retries.
- **Hierarchical Sovereignty:** The system maintains project-local control over its memory, identity, and governance.
