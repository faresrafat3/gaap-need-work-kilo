- Lessons learned are persisted and applied

---

## 2. Phase 2: The Safety Shield (Weeks 5-8) - COMPLETE

**Objective:** Secure the agent so it can run autonomously without supervision.

### Week 5: Docker Sandboxing ✅ COMPLETE
- `sandbox.py` - 412 lines of containerized execution
- `ExecutorPool` uses Docker instead of subprocess

### Week 6: Resource Limits & Firewalls ✅ COMPLETE
- `firewall.py` - 644 lines (7-layer security architecture)
- `rate_limiter.py` - Prevents resource exhaustion
- Network whitelist enforced

### Week 7: MCP Integration ✅ COMPLETE
- `mcp_client.py` - 419 lines
- Model Context Protocol for secure tool access
- Local filesystem via MCP (not direct access)

### Week 8: Security Audit ✅ COMPLETE
- 7-layer firewall architecture
- `semantic_shield.py` - AI-powered threat detection
- Red Team validated

---

## 3. Phase 3: The Swarm & Evolution (Weeks 9-12+) - COMPLETE

**Objective:** Scale intelligence via multiple agents and dynamic tools.

### Week 9: Dynamic Tool Synthesis ✅ COMPLETE
- `synthesizer.py` - 490 lines
- Agent can write its own Python helpers
- Self-extending capability

### Week 10: Fractal Swarm Prototype ✅ COMPLETE
- `swarm/orchestrator.py` - Multi-agent coordination
- `fractal.py` - 1,100 lines of fractal swarm architecture
- Coder + Critic pattern operational

### Week 11: Full Autonomy Loop ✅ COMPLETE
- Swarm + Memory + Sandbox fully integrated
- All 7 layers working in harmony
- Autonomous project execution

### Week 12+: Optimization ✅ COMPLETE
- MCTS Planning (Spec 48) - 834 lines of Monte Carlo Tree Search
- Meta-learning fine-tuning operational
- Continuous improvement loop active
