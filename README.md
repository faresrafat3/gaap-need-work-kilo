**GAAP** is a high-fidelity Sovereign AGI orchestration system. Built on the **OODA Loop** (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act), it transcends traditional coding assistants by integrating Deep Research, Predictive Simulation, and Metacognitive Awareness into a unified cognitive architecture.

## 🚀 Latest Release (v2.2.0)

**Code Quality Renaissance** - Major refactoring and cleanup:
- Type hints coverage: 35% → 80%
- Docstring coverage: 15% → 65%
- Dead code removal: ~8,500 lines
- New: SOP Governance, Axiom Validator, Kilo Gateway

## ✨ Key Cognitive Features

- **🧠 OODA Loop Engine**: A circular cognitive process that continuously observes the environment and learns from every action.
- **🔍 STORM Deep Research**: Augmented planning that performs exhaustive web/scientific research before making strategic decisions.
- **🧬 Dynamic Personas**: Agents that adopt specialized roles (Researcher, Debugger, Coder) with domain-specific tool filtering.
- **⚖️ SOP Governance**: Process-driven intelligence with mandatory artifact validation.
- **🛡️ Constitutional Axioms**: Invariant checks for syntax, dependencies, and interfaces.
- **🛠️ Just-in-Time Tool Synthesis**: The system autonomously writes and registers its own tools to overcome capability gaps.
- **💾 Domain-Partitioned Memory**: Hierarchical memory that segregates lessons by field for high-precision retrieval.

## 🧠 Cognitive Architecture

GAAP implements a multi-layered cognitive system that operates in a loop:

```
User Input → Layer 0: Observe → Layer 1: Orient → Layer 2: Decide → Layer 3: Act → Learn → Loop
```

| Phase | Engine Component | Responsibility |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| **OBSERVE** | `PromptFirewall` | Security scanning, intent classification, and environment sensing. |
| **ORIENT** | `StrategicToT` | Deep Research (STORM) and Strategy Generation (Tree of Thoughts). |
| **DECIDE** | `TacticalDecomposer` | Multi-domain task breakdown and dependency graph (DAG) construction. |
| **ACT** | `SpecializedExecutors` | Action execution with Genetic Twin verification and Tool Synthesis. |
| **LEARN** | `Metacognition` | Reflective learning, reputation updates, and episodic memory storage. |

## 📦 Quick Setup
